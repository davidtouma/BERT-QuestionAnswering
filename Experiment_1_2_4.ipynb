The code above only keeps answers that are inside the context, we need to also grab the score for the impossible answer (which has start and end indices corresponding to the index of the CLS token). When one example gives several features, we have to predict the impossible answer when all the features give a high score to the impossible answer (since one feature could predict the impossible answer just because the answer isn't in the part of the context it has access too), which is why the score of the impossible answer for one example is the *minimum* of the scores for the impossible answer in each feature generated by the example.\n\nWe then predict the impossible answer when that score is greater than the score of the best non-impossible answer.
